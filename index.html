            <h2>Vehicle Description</h2>
            <p>
 

                This two-owner 1974 1/2 MG MGB has been with the seller for 40 years and is powered by a rebuilt 1798cc inline-four engine backed by a rebuilt four-speed manual transmission. Features include a Sony AM/FM/cassette stereo, a wood-rim steering wheel, new tires, and a luggage rack. Finished in red and equipped with a new black convertible top over a black vinyl interior, this garage-kept MGB is available now and comes with a car cover, receipts, vehicle documentation, owner's and shop manuals, a box of additional parts, and Tennessee registration in the seller's name. 
                
                This is one of 5,273 1974 1/2 MGB roadsters exported to North America, according to the North American MGB Register. In 1995, the reportedly rust-free exterior was refinished in a Ferrari shade of red. Features include black rubber bumpers, a fender-mounted antenna, full-length side trim, a matte black driver-side mirror housing, white side accent stripes, a new black vinyl folding convertible top, and a chrome luggage rack. There are imperfections in the rear bumper that can be seen in the photos in the carousel to the right.
                
                A set of 14-inch black and silver Rostyle wheels with chrome center caps and trim rings is wrapped in new 185/70 Hankook Kinergy ST radial tires.
                
                The bucket seats, trim, and door panels are upholstered in black vinyl. Features include manual brakes, steering, and windows; a center console with a manual transmission shifter; a Sony AM/FM/cassette stereo; and a three-spoke steering wheel with a wood rim.
                
                A 120-mph speedometer, a 7K-rpm tachometer, and gauges for the fuel level, coolant temperature, and oil pressure are located ahead of the driver. With 118,000 miles added during current ownership, the rolled-over odometer reads 150,420 miles, which the seller reports to be accurate.
                
                Power is provided by a 1,798cc inline-four engine equipped with an APT (Advanced Performance Technology) performance camshaft and backed by a four-speed manual transmission. The seller notes that only 800 miles have been added to the car since the engine and transmission were rebuilt in 2016. In September 2021, the intake gasket and the intake manifold and carburetor spacers were replaced, the timing and the vacuum advance were adjusted, and the dual Triumph Spitfire 1500 carburetors were tuned.
                
                This MG was factory-equipped with an independent front suspension and a solid rear drive axle. Braking is provided by manual front discs and rear drums.

                Last year of this body. This has been a Central CA Valley truck all its life. Owned originally by a local sheriff. It has been well cared for and you can tell. All original unmolested engine, trans, body, suspension, etc… it has the v8 5.7l Chevrolet vortec engine mated to a 4 spd 700r4. It has 4x4 shift on the floor and everything on it works as it should including the oem stereo. Even the retractable light inside the engine bay. Brand new entire AC system, and steering components to ensure it drives straight down the road. New bfg tires and oem wheels. Come see it you won’t be disappointed. Currently titled and registered in CA with current CA smog. Ca smog is some of the most stringent regulations in the country. Has plenty of power and it feels great on the road. I have oem door seals in their original boxes and a complete aftermarket seal kit for the rest of the truck.
